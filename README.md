# Learn-Scale-Invariance
## It's not available now
### Just some test on object detection network,still have many bugs
Idea based on SNIP paper,I try to implement a structural that could limit detections resolution  
Now the experiments is based on SSD , because it's simple than D-R-FCN which the paper used
